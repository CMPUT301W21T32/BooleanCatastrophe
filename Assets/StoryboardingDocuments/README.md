# Product Backlog Documentation

## Summary
This folder is for keeping track of the storyboarding of the application.  Many team members used different tools so the documentation may not look very uniform but it provides a basis for UI design and an outline for different views/fragments the app will need.  This documentation will undoubtedly evolve over time as requirements/details become more clear.
