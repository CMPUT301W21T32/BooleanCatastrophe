# Product Backlog Documentation

## Summary
This folder is for keeping track of the product backlog and user story information.  Stories may be broken down further but provide a good basis for what still needs to be done and what the user expects when using our application.  There are 6 initial main categories, but documentation versions will undoubtedly evolve over time and become more specific/detailed.
